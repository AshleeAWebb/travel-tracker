# Travel Tracker 
## Abstract
Travel Tracker is an application designed to help both travelers and a travel agency manage and track trips. With the use of APIs to retrieve and add data, this application allows travelers to make trip requests, which can then be approved or denied by the travel agency. Additionally, Travel Tracker provides travelers with a dashboard that displays all their trips (past, upcoming, and pending), as well as the total amount they have spent on trips this year (including the travel agent's 10% fee).

## Context
This project was completed as a final solo project during the second module of the Turing Program. The focus of this project was to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to design the application and the code, work with an API to send and receive data, solidify the code review process, and create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application. This project was completed over a course of a week and took around 60 hours of work.

## Project Overview
Dashboard: As a traveler, the dashboard displays all your trips (past, upcoming, and pending) and the total amount you have spent on trips this year (including the travel agent's 10% fee).

Traveler Interaction: As a traveler, you can make a trip request by selecting a date, duration, number of travelers, and a destination from a list. Once you submit the trip request, it will show on your dashboard with the estimate price at which point you can confirm or cancel. If you confirm the trip is pushed to the travel agent and shows as "pending" until the travel agency can approve or deny it.If cancel is clicked it is cleared off the screen and is not sent to the travel agent. 

Accessibility: The accessibility branch aims to make the dashboard as accessible as possible using semantic html, aria-labels when needed, tabindex and running both wave, and lighthouse testing at 100%.

Login: As a traveler, you can log in using your username and password. Upon successful login, you will see your dashboard.
